      - The following stages form a flexible map of typical work. Small projects may omit steps. Progress is not always linear.
      - Larger organisations often run a paperwork-dense process. I adapt the stage set to the problem, and build as early as it is rational to do so. Changes usually get more expensive the later they occur, so we aim to de-risk early.
