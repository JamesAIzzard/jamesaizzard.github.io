  - id: cad
    label: General CAD
    framework_intro:
      - Focused, well-bounded work that moves quickly from a clarified brief to build‑ready CAD. Typical flow is S1 → S5, with S6/S7 used where supplier checks or a quick fit test adds confidence.
      - I rebuild or adapt geometry cleanly (parametric where useful), produce manufacturing drawings, and hand over a tidy package for quoting and production (S8). Where risk is minimal, we keep process overhead low and momentum high.
    stage_ids: [S1, S5, S6, S7, S8]
    briefs:
      - We inherited non-parametric legacy CAD/drawings and need clean updates.
      - We need a 3D scan and a parametric rebuild.
      - I've drawn this thing on a napkin, and I need to get it made.
      - This part has broken, and is no longer available, and I need a replacement.
      - I need to modify this existing part to fit a new assembly.

  - id: concept
    label: Concept Development
    framework_intro:
      - Breadth‑first exploration to define the right approach. We clarify aims and constraints in S1, generate options in S2, then select a direction in S3 based on evidence, constraints and acceptance tests.

  - id: research
    label: Research & Equipment Development
    framework_intro:
      - Goal‑driven, empirical work to create rigs, fixtures or lab equipment. We define the measurable outcome in S1, explore and select viable architectures (S2/S3), then aggressively de‑risk hotspots in S4.
      - Expect practical S5–S7 loops: quick CAD, fast builds, test‑measure‑iterate. Once converged, we hand over clean data and support first‑use in the lab or on the line (S8).
    stage_ids: [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8]
    briefs:
      - I need a custom machine to automate this experiment.

      - Supplier sync (S6) and one or two prototype passes (S7) are typical. I package data for production and support a smooth handover (S8).
    stage_ids: [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8]
    briefs:
      - I need to develop this concept into a manufacturable product.
