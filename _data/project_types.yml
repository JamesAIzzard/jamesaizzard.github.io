types:
  - briefs:
      - We inherited non-parametric legacy CAD/drawings and need clean updates.
      - We need a 3D scan and a parametric rebuild.
      - I've drawn this thing on a napkin, and I need to get it made.
      - This part has broken, and is no longer available, and I need a replacement.
      - I need to modify this existing part to fit a new assembly.
    characteristics:
      - Well-defined scope and requirements
      - Generally straightforward
      - Typically single fixed price quote
      - Typically fast turnaround
      - Single package of work with low uncertainty
    deliverables:
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings

  - briefs:
      - I need a custom machine to automate this experiment.
      - We need a test-rig to de-risk this aspect of a larger project and our main design team doesn't have the bandwidth.
      - Our production team is struggling with this aspect of assembly and needs this assembly tooling.
    characteristics:
      - May require a phase-gated approach, depending on complexity and risk.
      - Often collaborative, with scientists, engineers and technicians.
      - Collaboration with an electrical engineer & software developer.
      - May require analysis and calculations to inform design.
      - Often requires building one or multiple prototypes.
    deliverables:
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings
      - Functional prototype
      - Ongoing support

  - briefs:
      - I need to turn my idea into a prototype to show an investor.
      - Our design team is fully occupied with other projects and we need to progress this concept to beta prototype.
      - I need to develop the concept for my kickstarter campaign into a working device.
    characteristics:
      - Higher risk, typically justifying a phase-gated approach.
      - Clearly defined phase outputs and progression criteria.
      - Detailed documentation of design rationale.
      - Collaboration with an industrial designer.
      - Collaboration with an electrical engineer & software developer.
      - Collaboration with various stakeholders throughout the process.
    deliverables:
      - Concepts, illustrations, detailed concept selection documentation
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings
      - Working prototype(s)
      - Ongoing support
