types:
  - briefs:
      - We inherited non-parametric legacy CAD/drawings and need clean updates.
      - We need a 3D scan and a parametric rebuild.
      - I've drawn this thing on a napkin, and I need to get it made.
      - This part has broken, and is no longer available, and I need a replacement.
      - I need to modify this existing part to fit a new assembly.
    characteristics:
      - Well-defined scope and requirements
      - Generally straightforward
      - Typically single fixed price quote
      - Typically fast turnaround
      - Single package of work with low uncertainty
    deliverables:
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings
    id: cad
    label: General CAD
    scales:
      time: 1
      phases: single
      pricing: fixed
  - briefs:
      - I need to turn my idea into a prototype to show an investor.
      - I need help understanding the feasibility of my idea.
      - I need some graphics to illustrate my concept.
      - I need a detailed concept to get an early quote from a manufacturer.
      - I need a visual model of my idea to help with fundraising.
    characteristics:
      - Fairly open-ended scope and requirements
      - Low risk, often justifying a single phase approach.
      - Fixed price quote possible, depending on clarity of brief.
      - Typically fast turnaround
      - Often some iteration as we explore the possible directions.
    deliverables:
      - Physical models
      - 3D models & renderings
      - Illustrations & concept documentation

  - briefs:
      - I need a custom machine to automate this experiment.
      - We need a test-rig to de-risk this aspect of a larger project and our main design team doesn't have the bandwidth.
      - Our production team is struggling with this aspect of assembly and needs this assembly tooling.
    characteristics:
      - May require a phase-gated approach, depending on complexity and risk.
      - Often collaborative, with scientists, engineers and technicians.
      - Collaboration with an electrical engineer & software developer.
      - May require analysis and calculations to inform design.
      - Often requires building one or multiple prototypes.
    deliverables:
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings
      - Functional prototype
      - Ongoing support

  - briefs:
      - I need to develop this concept into a manufacturable product.
      - Our design team is fully occupied with other projects and we need to progress this concept to beta prototype.
      - I need to develop the concept for my kickstarter campaign into a working device.
    characteristics:
      - Simple product, single part or small assembly, often purely mechanical (no electronics or software).
      - Typically involves a few phases depending on complexity and how well defined the brief is.
      - Clearly defined phase outputs and progression criteria.
      - Detailed documentation of design rationale.
      - May require collaboration with an industrial designer.
      - May require collaboration with an electrical engineer & software developer.
      - May require collaboration with various stakeholders throughout the process.
    deliverables:
      - Concepts, illustrations, detailed concept selection documentation
      - 3D models & manufacturing drawings
      - Working prototype(s)
      - Ongoing support
