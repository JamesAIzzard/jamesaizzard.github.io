    framework_intro:
      - Focused, well-bounded work that can move quickly from a clarified brief to build-ready CAD. Typical examples are creating single parts, reparing legacy CAD, modifying existing parts, or rebuilding from 3D scans. For this work, I can usually quote fixed price, and turnaround is often a matter of days.
    stage_ids: [S1, S5, S6, S7, S8]
    briefs:
      - We inherited non-parametric legacy CAD/drawings and need clean updates.

    label: Concept Development
    framework_intro:
      - Breadth-first exploration to define the right approach. We typically clarify aims and constraints in, generate a wide range of concepts, then select a direction in based on evidence, constraints and acceptance tests. Sometimes, initial de-risking is conducted to increase confidence in the selected design direction.

  - id: research
    label: Research & Equipment Development
    framework_intro:
      - Goal-driven, empirical work to create rigs, fixtures or lab or industrial equipment. Often, these can involve concept generation through to detailed design, but with less emphasis on supplier engagement, since the device is often not intended for volume manufacture, and therefore may not require detailed handover to production.
    stage_ids: [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S7]
    briefs:
      - I need a custom machine to automate this experiment.
      - We need a test-rig to de-risk this aspect of a larger project and our main design team doesn't have the bandwidth.
      - Our production team is struggling with this aspect of assembly and needs this assembly tooling.
    characteristics:
      - head: Scope & requirements
        desc: Technical goal clearly defined; solution space open.
      - head: Uncertainty & risk
        desc: Moderate; empirical learning expected.
      - head: Pricing
        desc: Typically hourly; fixed-price blocks for well-bounded tasks.
      - head: Turnaround
        desc: Weeks to a couple of months, driven by experiments, lead times and complexity.
      - head: Collaboration
        desc: Often requires collaboration with scientists/engineers/operators.
      - head: Analysis & calculations
        desc: Targeted calculations/measurements to inform design choices.
      - head: Prototyping
        desc: Often requires one or more functional rigs with incremental testing.

  - id: product-simple
    label: Simple Product Development
    framework_intro:
      - End-to-end development for a small, relatively simple product. We shape the brief, explore and select options, and de-risk early with targeted tests so detailed design proceeds with confidence. Manufacturing volumes is a key consideration throughout, and often requires detailed reviews with suppliers and manufacturers. A few prototype passes are typical, and detailed documentation supports a handover to production.
    stage_ids: [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8]
    briefs:
      - I need to develop this concept into a manufacturable product.
      - Our design team is fully occupied with other projects and we need to progress this concept to beta prototype.
      - I need to develop the concept for my Kickstarter campaign into a working device.
    characteristics:
      - head: Scope & requirements
        desc: Focused scope; single part or small assembly, often purely mechanical.
      - head: Uncertainty & risk
        desc: Moderate; depending on complexity and novelty.
      - head: Pricing
        desc: Typically hourly with milestone reviews; fixed-price for discrete, well-defined packages.
      - head: Turnaround
        desc: Several weeks to a few months, depending on supplier lead times.
      - head: Collaboration
        desc: Often requires collaboration with industrial designers, electrical/software engineers, suppliers, and stakeholders.
      - head: Analysis & calculations
        desc: Deeper analysis and verification planning as appropriate.
      - head: Prototyping
        desc: One or more working prototypes for fit/function.

  - id: product-complex
    label: Complex Product Development
    framework_intro:
      - System-level development with multiple subsystems and stakeholders. We invest in clear acceptance tests and evidence-based selection, and de-risk before detailed design. Often, specialists from multiple disciplines are involved. Supplier engagement is critical to confirm manufacturability, cost and lead time. Several prototype passes are typical, with testing and iteration to refine performance and reliability. Handover typically requires detailed documentation to support complex assembly and commisioning.
