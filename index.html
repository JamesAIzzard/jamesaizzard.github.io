        <p>
            With over a decade in life-science product development, I've worked across a wide range of manufacturing
            processes - from
            the everyday to the highly specialised. If something unfamiliar comes up, I know how to track down the right
            expertise and get it made.

                    <p>Concepts are translated into tangible sketches through collaborative sessions, building
                        shared understanding while highlighting constraints and opportunities. This visual
                        approach turns abstract requirements into clear, actionable designs, suitable for
                        testing with clients or presenting to investors. By exploring ideas through rapid
                        sketching, the process establishes a foundation that balances innovation with practical
                        considerations, making complex concepts both accessible and engaging.</p>

                    <p>I have extensive experience in sheet metal design and strong links with trusted local suppliers.
                        Together we can approach tricky requirements and usually deliver parts within 7-10 working
                        days. Finishes include welding, powder coating, anodising and more, in both low and high
                        volumes.</p>
