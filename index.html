        <div class="pill-buttons"></div>

        <p>
            With over a decade in life-science product development, I've worked across a wide range of manufacturing
            processes - from the everyday to the highly specialised. If something unfamiliar comes up, I know how to
            track down the right expertise and get it made.

                    <h2>CNC Machining</h2>
                    <p>CNC machining removes material from a stock block to produce the required geometry. Most
                        prototypes and many products rely on machined parts, and I’ve designed components across a wide
                        range of materials. Through close collaboration with local machining partners, I have rapid
                        access to modern 5-axis CNC machines and CNC lathes. By reviewing designs directly with
                        programmers, I ensure parts are optimised for their processes, with typical turnaround times of
                        5–10 working days in common materials.</p>

                    <h2>Sheet Metal</h2>
                    <p>I have extensive experience in sheet metal design and strong links with trusted local suppliers.
                        Together we can approach tricky requirements and usually deliver parts within 7-10 working
                        days. Finishes include welding, powder coating, anodising and more, in both low and high
                        volumes.</p>
