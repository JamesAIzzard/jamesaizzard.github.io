        <h2>Right-sized, collaborative development</h2>
        <p>
            I work with founders, start-ups, scientists, and inventors. When a project calls for a
            <strong>focused development, proof-of-principle build, or prototype</strong>, you don’t need a
            multi-year programme.
            I bring major-consultancy calibre design quickly and flexibly—so together we take the simplest path that
            fully
            meets the requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ve built a strong network of technical, design, and manufacturing contacts. When we work together,
            that network
            becomes your leverage—helping us complete projects efficiently, with minimal investment, while still
            getting to the
            right answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not an ISO13485 facility and I don’t run a biolab or anechoic chamber. I do deliver fast,
            professional mechanical
            design and prototypes to big-business standards.
