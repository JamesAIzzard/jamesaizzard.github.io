                    <h2>Right-sized, collaborative development</h2>
                    <p>
                        I work with founders, start-ups, scientists, and inventors. When a project calls for a
                        <strong>focused development, proof-of-principle build, or prototype</strong>, you don't need a
                        multi-year programme.
                        I bring major-consultancy calibre design quickly and flexibly, so together we take the simplest
                        path
                        that
                        fully
                        meets the requirements.

                        I've built a strong network of technical, design, and manufacturing contacts. When we work
                        together,
                        that network
                        becomes your leverage, helping us complete projects efficiently, with minimal investment, while
                        still
                        getting to the
                        right answer.

                        I'm not an ISO13485 facility and I don't run a biolab or anechoic chamber. I do deliver fast,
                        professional mechanical
                        design and prototypes to big-business standards.
