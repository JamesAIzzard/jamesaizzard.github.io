                    <p>Products fail most often at the start. The quickest way to learn is to build something real, expose risks, and adjust. I focus on early research and product prototypes that surface design faults, supply risks, and usability gaps while the design is still flexible.</p>
                    <p>You gain access to my trusted network of technical, design, and manufacturing experts. Together we move quickly, keep spending tight, and give your ideas the best chance of success.</p>
