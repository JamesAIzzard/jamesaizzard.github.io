    <p>
      With over a decade in life-science product development, I've worked across a wide range of manufacturing
      processes - from the everyday to the highly specialised. If something unfamiliar comes up, I know how to
      track down the right expertise and get it made.

          <h3>CNC Machining</h3>
          <p>CNC machining removes material from a stock block to produce the required geometry. Most
            prototypes and many products rely on machined parts, and I’ve designed components across a wide
            range of materials. Through close collaboration with local machining partners, I have rapid
            access to modern 5-axis CNC machines and CNC lathes. By reviewing designs directly with
            programmers, I ensure parts are optimised for their processes, with typical turnaround times of
            5–10 working days in common materials.</p>

          <h3>Sheet Metal</h3>
          <p>Sheet metal components are produced by cutting flat profiles and folding them into the required
            geometry. I have extensive experience in sheet metal design and work closely with trusted local
            suppliers to tackle challenging requirements. This collaboration allows us to deliver parts in
            as little as 7–10 working days, with a wide range of finishing options including welding, powder
            coating, anodising and more, available in both low and high volumes.</p>

          <h3>3D Printing</h3>
          <p>Modern 3D printing can produce almost any geometry, with an expanding range of materials covering
            stiffness, toughness, chemical resistance and more. I work closely with local suppliers offering
            SLS, FDM, SLA and large-format FDM, with parts often available as quickly as next day—making it
            an excellent route for early prototypes. I also maintain two in-house FDM printers, which I use
            to de-risk and validate designs during development.</p>

          <h3>Laser/Water Cutting</h3>
          <p>Laser cutting provides fast, precise 2D profiling across a wide range of materials. Sheet metal
            suppliers typically handle their own metal cutting in-house, while trusted local partners
            support us with non-metallic materials such as plastics and composites. This approach provides
            rapid access to accurate flat parts, either as standalone components or integrated into larger
            assemblies, or feed into secondary processes.</p>

        <div class="panel-text">
          <h3>Thermoforming</h3>
          <p>Thermoforming shapes heated plastic sheets over moulds to create lightweight, durable components.
            This can be useful for packaging, covers, and often early prototypes of moulded parts.
            Because the process demands significant expertise, our close relationship with an excellent
            local supplier is a real advantage. By drawing on their experience early in the design stage, we
            ensure parts are optimised for manufacturability and delivered efficiently, whether as
            prototypes or production-ready components.</p>

      <div id="casting" class="panel">
        <div class="panel-text">
          <h3>Casting</h3>
          <p>Casting involves pouring molten material into a mould to form complex, often large-scale parts
            with excellent strength and durability. It is particularly suited to components that would be
            difficult or uneconomical to machine, such as housings or other intricate geometries. I first
            encountered casting during my time at Terex, where I gained a strong grounding in the design
            rules and constraints of
            the process. While I don't maintain close supplier contacts in this area, I know where to turn
            should the requirement arise.</p>

          <h3>Moulding</h3>
          <p>Moulding processes—such as injection, vacuum, compression and blow moulding, enable the
            production
            of an exceptionally wide variety of parts. Depending on the technique, components can be
            flexible, rigid, transparent, textured, or produced at high volume and low cost. With strong
            relationships across the moulding industry, I can draw on different suppliers' expertise to
            match
            each design to the right process, ensuring efficient delivery from early prototypes through to
            full-scale production.</p>
