    <h2>Manufacturing Technologies</h2>

    <p>
      Effective design starts with an eye on the end manufacturing process. Components are shaped, toleranced and
      specified to suit how they'll be made. Having worked across a wide variety of industries, my experience spans
      mainstream and specialised processes, granting me a diverse network of contacts to get almost anything made.

          <h3>CNC Machining</h3>
          <p>CNC machining removes material from a stock block to produce the required geometry. Most
            prototypes and many products rely on machined parts. I've designed countless machined components and am
            comfortable creating precision designs for manufacture in a wide range of materials.</p>

          <p>I have an excellent relationship with several local, highly skilled machinists, giving me access to
            modern 5-axis CNC machines and CNC lathes. I can review challenging pieces directly with the machinist,
            ensuring each part is as manufacturable as possible.</p>
          <p>Machined parts can be available within 5-10 working days, depending on material and
            complexity.</p>

          <h3>Sheet Metal</h3>
          <p>Sheet metal components are produced by cutting flat profiles and folding them into the required
            geometry. Sheet metal often forms the basis of instrument caseworks, chassis and frames.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have extensive experience in sheet metal design and work closely with a trusted local
            supplier to tackle challenging requirements. This collaboration often allows us to obtain parts in
            as around 7-10 working days, with a wide range of finishing options including welding, powder
            coating, anodising and more, available in both low and high volumes.</p>

          <h3>3D Printing</h3>
          <p>Modern 3D printing can produce almost any geometry, with an ever-expanding range of materials covering
            stiffness, toughness, chemical resistance, and more. It has been a game-changing development, enabling
            earlier and more frequent prototyping.</p>

          <p>I work closely with local suppliers offering SLS, FDM, SLA, and large-format FDM, with parts often
            available as quickly as the next day—making it an excellent route for early prototypes. I also maintain
            two in-house FDM printers, which I use to de-risk and validate designs during development.</p>

          <h3>Laser/Water Cutting</h3>
          <p>Laser cutting provides fast, cost-effective, precise 2D profiling across a wide range of materials.
            Sheet metal suppliers typically handle their own cutting in-house.</p>
          <p>I regularly work with a local supplier who can profile non-metallic materials such as plastics
            and composites.</p>

          <h3>Thermoforming</h3>
          <p>Thermoforming shapes heated plastic sheets over moulds to create lightweight, durable components.
            It is commonly used for packaging, covers, and early prototypes of moulded parts. Because the process
            requires significant expertise, designs often benefit from careful review with the supplier.</p>
          <p>I work regularly with several highly skilled contacts, selecting the right partner depending on the
            specific
            process involved.</p>

        <div class="panel-text">
          <h3>Casting</h3>
          <p>Casting involves pouring molten material into a mould to create complex, often large-scale parts
            with excellent strength and durability. It is particularly suited to components that would be
            difficult or uneconomical to machine, such as housings or other intricate geometries.</p>

          <p>I first encountered casting during my time at Terex, where I gained a solid grounding in the design
            rules and constraints of the process. While I don't maintain close supplier contacts in this area,
            I know where to turn should the requirement arise.</p>

          <h3>Moulding</h3>
          <p>Moulding processes—such as injection, vacuum, compression, and blow moulding—enable the
            production of an exceptionally wide variety of plastic parts. Depending on the technique,
            components can be flexible, rigid, transparent, textured, produced at high volume and low cost.</p>

          <p>This is another area where involving the manufacturer early in the design pays dividends, as
            they typically have a great deal of process experience and can advise on design adjustments to
            avoid issues that may be costly to resolve.</p>
