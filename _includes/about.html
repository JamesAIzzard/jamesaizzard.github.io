            <h2>About me</h2>

            <div class="about-tldr">
                <p>
                    I'm a Chartered Mechanical Engineer with first-class master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and
                    Intelligent Systems & Robotics, and over 15 years' experience developing products and machines in
                    professional settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am experienced in designing electro-mechanical systems in a wide range of contexts, including
                    life science, renewable energy, scientific equipment, packaging equipment, and heavy industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had the opportunity to work end-to-end across the development processes, seeing several
                    products progress from initial sketches and into final production. I have been the sole design
                    engineer on several major programmes during my time in industry.
