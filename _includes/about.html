                    <summary><strong>TTP</strong> Electro-mechanical systems for life science</summary>
                    <p>Mechanical engineering consultant delivering electromechanical solutions for life-science
                        instruments. I worked hands-on across optics, thermal control, pneumatics, and microfluidics,
                        from
                        CAD and analysis to prototype build and test. Tools included Onshape, Creo, SolidWorks, and
                        Python for modelling and control.</p>
